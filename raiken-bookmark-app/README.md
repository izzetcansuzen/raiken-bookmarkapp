# RaikenSW Bookmark App

Hello, welcome to the **bookmark application** that I created to meet my own needs!

The application consists of more than one version, I have created v1 for now. In this version;

- User login,register
- Add Bookmark
- Listing Bookmarks
- Admin panel
- Admin can add categories

I plan to bring many features with version2 such as **text editor**, **uploading photos**.

Thank you for reading.

## DESIGN

<hr>

### First of all, I prepared the mobile design.

Even though I chose a colorful design as the color, I later gave up on it and switched to a black and white design. I'll go back to the color model if I want to.
